ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸŽ“ I'm a passionate college student with a knack for software development and a love for learning. Currently, I'm pursuing my degree while diving deep into the realms of Java, Node.js, and Python.

ðŸ’» I specialize in object-oriented programming and have hands-on experience in crafting robust solutions using Java.
 ----------------------------------------------------------
ðŸŒ± I'm constantly exploring new horizons, and machine learning has caught my attention lately. You'll often find me diving into tutorials, experimenting with datasets, and coding up ML models in my spare time.

ðŸ“« If you'd like to collaborate, have any questions, or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to me!
You can drop me an email at srishtijha58@gmail.com .
